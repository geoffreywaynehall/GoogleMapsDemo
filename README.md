# GoogleMapsDemo

This demo utilizes the Google maps API and Angular.
The app takes a string and passes it to the Google maps API and displays the location on the map.
It also allows the user to save and recall locations from the browser's local storage.

Note: The app will not run unless it is connected to a billing account.
